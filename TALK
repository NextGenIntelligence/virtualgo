Virtual Go - Simulating rigid body dynamics of a go board and stones

Takeaway:

    Attendees will learn the basics of rigid body kinematics, collision detection 
    and impulse-based collision response in the context of a worked example.

Outline:

    Introduction to the game of Go.

    The go stone shape: Intersection of two spheres = Biconvex solid.

    Work through various properties of the shape: How to generate a stone of the desired dimensions.

    How does the stone move? Rigid body kinematics overview.

    How to detect collision with the board board? Separating Axis Test. 
    Determine span of biconvex along axis. Break down cases of collision with board.

    How does the stone bounce? Impulse based collision response. 
    
    Linear effects. Coefficient of restitution. 

    Angular effects.

    Derive inertia tensor for go stone: numerically first, then closed form. 

    Develop an intuitive understanding for inertia tensor + the angular component 
    of the collision response along the normal direction.

    Friction effects.

    Basics of coulomb friction. Friction = component of collision response along the tangent direction. Intuitive understanding of the friction component of collision response and the part that it plays in realistic bouncing/tumbling motion.

    End result: A go stone bouncing with realistic collision response and friction then coming to rest on the board.
