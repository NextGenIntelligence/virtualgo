    Things are very clearly NOT right with the edge collision case

    The stone is getting pushed out too far. Also, the normal is
    not correct. I believe that it is an error to not use the
    edge normal as the push out / contact normal.

    However, in OTHER cases, it is better to use the biconvex
    normal than the edge normal. How to determine which normal
    to use deterministically?

    --------------------------------------------------------

    I'm pretty sure I've worked out why some edge collisions
    are weird. In the case of circle edge vs. board edge
    we should always use the board normal not the biconvex
    circle edge normal.

    If we are using the circle edge normal then this would
    explain the strange (rare) bounce back against the back
    of the edge that I see.

    --------------------------------------------------------

    I've noticed that the angular momentum -> velocity
    appears to be operating in a strange way. eg. a wobble
    like a gyroscope is happening on the stone when it is
    rotating off axis.

    Is this supposed to happen?

    Perhaps I should switch to linear velocity for this demo?

    I probably should because the article makes no mention
    of inertia tensor or angular or linear momentum being
    usaged instead of velocity. It would be confusing

    Need some way to adjust brightness because they grey
    board is likely to be difficult to see without turning
    the lights off on a projector

    --------------------------------------------------------

    For the proper demo of the board provide best camera
    angles (as minimal as possible) that support common
    views for playing.

    Basically, a top down view, a side-on view, and a zoom
    view which supports scrolling at an ideal distance back.

    This should be separate from the collision demo.

    --------------------------------------------------------

    When sliding the stone diagonal should not be faster
    than left/right/up/down
    
    --------------------------------------------------------

    Really need to add a blurry shadow to the go stone on
    the board. This will complete the visual look!

    --------------------------------------------------------

    If you through the go stone at the corner (and edge?)
    in some cases it's possible to get the stone to "bounce back"
    as if it hit some invisible wall.

    Is there some error in the push out logic?

    Or some error in the nearest point?
