DONE:

    Fixed the lights on the stone to look a lot better

    Create a new mode "Textured" (5)

    Integrate stb_image and load murasaki.jpg

    Create opengl texture objects

    Extend the tesselator so that it generates UV coordinates

    Extend the mesh render so it emits texture UVs

    Improve the lighting on the board

    Render the background as dark grey so black stones
    have some chance of being visible :)

TODO:

    Work out why the fuck the texture is not showing up

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Apply murasaki texture to the go stone

    Apply wood texture to the go board

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Damping needs to be made approximately framerate independent

    Why? Because in slow motion mode it really goes to town ... =p

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Finish the article series

    Back port to talk slides

    --------------------------------------------------------
