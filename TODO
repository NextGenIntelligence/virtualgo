DONE:

    Restore basic biconvex class with math to determine sphere radius
    and offset for a given biconvex width and height.

    Get the vector library back up and running from scoopr. 
    Don't resurrect my own crappy library that isn't SIMD!!!

TODO:

    Port across intersection and distance tests already written

        1. biconvex vs. plane
        2. ray intersection with biconvex
        3. probably need to redesign biconvex vs. biconvex!

    Get unit testing framework going and start doing unit tests to verify
    correct behavior of collision queries etc.

    Get a basic opengl display going.

    Render some wireframe approximation of a floor plane and the biconvex shape

    Visually verify intersection point/normal with biconvex and plane

    Visually verify intersection point/normal between biconvex
