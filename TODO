    Looking top-down there appear to be cracks in the go stone

    How is this possible? It should be perfectly welded!

    The first step is to understand whether the incorrect
    welding is on *BOTH* top and bottom, or only one side
    of the stone.

    If it's one one side then it could indicate slightly 
    different on the top and bottom rings, for some reason
    (not really sure why this would be...?)

    Alternatively, I'm fresh out of ideas

    --------------------------------------------------------

    If you through the go stone at the corner (and edge?)
    in some cases it's possible to get the stone to "bounce back"
    as if it hit some invisible wall.

    Is there some error in the push out logic?

    Or some error in the nearest point?
