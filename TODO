    I've noticed that the angular momentum -> velocity
    appears to be operating in a strange way. eg. a wobble
    like a gyroscope is happening on the stone when it is
    rotating off axis.

    Is this supposed to happen?

    Perhaps I should switch to linear velocity for this demo?

    I probably should because the article makes no mention
    of inertia tensor or angular or linear momentum being
    usaged instead of velocity. It would be confusing

    Separate collision demo

    Same demo will cover collision detection,
    collision detection with push out (tunelling)
    and various collision response.

    The demo will NOT render a full board, and will run
    only in wireframe.

    The demo will NOT cover board edge and corner cases

    The demo will not have a floor, it is a go board
    with drop off when outside primary surface case.

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Need some way to adjust brightness because they grey
    board is likely to be difficult to see without turning
    the lights off on a projector

    --------------------------------------------------------

    For the proper demo of the board provide best camera
    angles (as minimal as possible) that support common
    views for playing.

    Basically, a top down view, a side-on view, and a zoom
    view which supports scrolling at an ideal distance back.

    This should be separate from the collision demo.

    --------------------------------------------------------

    When sliding the stone diagonal should not be faster
    than left/right/up/down
    
    --------------------------------------------------------

    Really need to add a blurry shadow to the go stone on
    the board. This will complete the visual look!

    --------------------------------------------------------

    If you through the go stone at the corner (and edge?)
    in some cases it's possible to get the stone to "bounce back"
    as if it hit some invisible wall.

    Is there some error in the push out logic?

    Or some error in the nearest point?

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Finish the article series

    Back port to talk slides

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Get polarized lense filters to remove stone highlight

    Rent a better camera

    Capture all go stone textures top and bottom

    Capture board texture kaya including sides

    Create Texture.h to manage sets of textures easily

    Switch to DDS files with offline mipmap generation
