TODO:

    Rent a better camera

    Capture a better murasaki go stone texture

    Capture a wood texture for the board

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Looking top-down there appear to be cracks in the go stone

    How is this possible? It should be perfectly welded!

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Damping needs to be made approximately framerate independent

    Why? Because in slow motion mode it really goes to town ... =p

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Finish the article series

    Back port to talk slides
