TODO:

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Adjust collision to use go board instead of ground plane

    Adjust go board and grid render to render at z = thickness

    Adjust checkpoints to differentiate ground and board collision
    cases: sliding, spinning, come to rest etc.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Pass over go stone side and corner cases and fix to work with
    right handed collision (do in Mac app)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Project go stone shadow onto board

    Set clip rect to keep go stone shadow projected onto board
    from spilling over onto floor. This will have to be adjusted
    to use stencil or something else if I ever allow the camera
    to move from top-down.

    Project board shadow onto floor

    Detect when go stone is shadowed by board and darken it

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Really need to get textures for go board lines

    This is required for anti-aliasing effect, otherwise
    some lines look thicker than others top-down.

    Textures are simple. Reuse original Virtual Go textures

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Add star points to 9x9 board

    Recover star point textures from original Virtual Go

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement a way to place the stone: one finger hold then tap
    to confirm the stone placement

    Ideally, this would also snap to nearest grid (add grid lines...)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement a way to pick the stone up with two finger swipe
    towards the stone, this is something Evan Cho naturally tried
    to do, therefore it is intuitive and I should support it. 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Double tap zoom in should remember the specific point where the
    zoom in was requested on the board, and zoom in centered around
    that point.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Adjust light source dynamically and interpolate between

    This will allow shadows on the side orientations like I want
    while still allowing divergent shadows while the device is
    flat on the table like a board.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------








    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Work out how to render the shadow to texture

    Create a new shadow to pass over the shadow texture
    and blur it out using a gaussian blur

    Write a new shadow to blur back the shadow texture onto the board

    Make the shadow blur out and fade out as the stone moves away
    from the go board. This should give a sense of depth.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Generate a mipmap from the texture and turn on trilinear filtering
    (need to recover VirtualGo.cpp and copy the code from there)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Capture go stone sounds

    Buy a microphone

    Research how to capture foley

    Need sound of stone hitting board with different variations

    Stone hitting metal for the sides of the frustum

    Stone hitting glass for the front screen

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Capture go stone diffuse textures

    Implement some way to swipe select between go stone textures

    Perhaps double swipe up/down -- I'd like to let the user
    mix and match go stones with different go boards, and perhaps
    save them off as presets.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement double swipe detection

    Double swipe left/right select between different go board 
    textures, eg. light, dark, red wood etc.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------









    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Seems that hold sometimes does not trigger. Not sure why yet?
    It seems that touch began triggers, but somehow the hold doesn't
    kick in. Maybe the touch began but it doesn't know where?
    Anyway, this is reproduceable so can be fixed later.

    Pops occur in the corners/edges. Need iterative contacts.

    Blow into the microphone moves the stone up (iphone only)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Prefer spin direction the stone is already spinning around on swipe

    If there is no existing rotation 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    The accelerometer not being accurate on side tilt is actually
    not true, it is caused by the frustum planes being not exactly
    flat.

    I'm not sure if I should do anything about this.

    I cannot clamp the value as I want tilting to work on side planes

    I could consider some sort of clamp to nearest plane normal
    concept if within some tolerence, this might be a good idea
    but would make sliding asymmetrical with the floor.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement one-two click for placing stone

    First click places the stone but holds it in an alpha state? 
    50% alpha? It's where it will go, but it's not here yet...

    Stone should pulse in alpha actually while being placed...!

    Second click locks in the stone and it goes solid opaque quickly.

    Ideally sound effects for both phase, click - pah. 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement board render texture

    Implement board render with grid lines

    Implement better lighting

    Implement simple shadow (projection)

    Implement iterative solver for simultaneous constraints (eg. corners)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------
















    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Fix tessellation demo so the two tessellation methods match

    Fix the rotation and lighting back how it was with y<->z

    Fix up the dynamics demo

    Fix up the unit tests

    Move the video recording framework into Platform.h/cpp so
    it isn't cut & paste in every demo program!

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Fix sphere vs. edge to include axes corresponding to
    each sphere touching the edge -- right now, not exact
    unless sphere hits 45 degrees.

    Fix bounce back off inside edge collision case (repro first)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------








    --------------------------------------------------------

    Need some way to adjust brightness because they grey
    board is likely to be difficult to see without turning
    the lights off on a projector

    --------------------------------------------------------

    For the proper demo of the board provide best camera
    angles (as minimal as possible) that support common
    views for playing.

    Basically, a top down view, a side-on view, and a zoom
    view which supports scrolling at an ideal distance back.

    This should be separate from the collision demo.

    --------------------------------------------------------

    When sliding the stone diagonal should not be faster
    than left/right/up/down
    
    --------------------------------------------------------

    Really need to add a blurry shadow to the go stone on
    the board. This will complete the visual look!

    --------------------------------------------------------

    If you through the go stone at the corner (and edge?)
    in some cases it's possible to get the stone to "bounce back"
    as if it hit some invisible wall.

    Is there some error in the push out logic?

    Or some error in the nearest point?

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Finish the article series

    Back port to talk slides

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Get polarized lense filters to remove stone highlight

    Rent a better camera

    Capture all go stone textures top and bottom

    Capture board texture kaya including sides

    Create Texture.h to manage sets of textures easily

    Switch to DDS files with offline mipmap generation
