TODO:

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Get icon ready

    Get app ready to testflight so other people can play with it

    This is the most important step now. 

    It is good enough to get testers playing around with it!

    -----------------------------------------------------------------





    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Polish:

    Seems that hold sometimes does not trigger. Not sure why yet?
    It seems that touch began triggers, but somehow the hold doesn't
    kick in. Maybe the touch began but it doesn't know where?
    Anyway, this is reproduceable so can be fixed later.

    Pops occur in the corners/edges. Need iterative contacts.

    Blow into the microphone moves the stone up (iphone only)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Prefer spin direction the stone is already spinning around on swipe

    If there is no existing rotation 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    The accelerometer not being accurate on side tilt is actually
    not true, it is caused by the frustum planes being not exactly
    flat.

    I'm not sure if I should do anything about this.

    I cannot clamp the value as I want tilting to work on side planes

    I could consider some sort of clamp to nearest plane normal
    concept if within some tolerence, this might be a good idea
    but would make sliding asymmetrical with the floor.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement one-two click for placing stone

    First click places the stone but holds it in an alpha state? 
    50% alpha? It's where it will go, but it's not here yet...

    Stone should pulse in alpha actually while being placed...!

    Second click locks in the stone and it goes solid opaque quickly.

    Ideally sound effects for both phase, click - pah. 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement board render texture

    Implement board render with grid lines

    Implement better lighting

    Implement simple shadow (projection)

    Implement iterative solver for simultaneous constraints (eg. corners)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------
















    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Fix tessellation demo so the two tessellation methods match

    Fix the rotation and lighting back how it was with y<->z

    Fix up the dynamics demo

    Fix up the unit tests

    Move the video recording framework into Platform.h/cpp so
    it isn't cut & paste in every demo program!

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Fix sphere vs. edge to include axes corresponding to
    each sphere touching the edge -- right now, not exact
    unless sphere hits 45 degrees.

    Fix bounce back off inside edge collision case (repro first)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------








    --------------------------------------------------------

    Need some way to adjust brightness because they grey
    board is likely to be difficult to see without turning
    the lights off on a projector

    --------------------------------------------------------

    For the proper demo of the board provide best camera
    angles (as minimal as possible) that support common
    views for playing.

    Basically, a top down view, a side-on view, and a zoom
    view which supports scrolling at an ideal distance back.

    This should be separate from the collision demo.

    --------------------------------------------------------

    When sliding the stone diagonal should not be faster
    than left/right/up/down
    
    --------------------------------------------------------

    Really need to add a blurry shadow to the go stone on
    the board. This will complete the visual look!

    --------------------------------------------------------

    If you through the go stone at the corner (and edge?)
    in some cases it's possible to get the stone to "bounce back"
    as if it hit some invisible wall.

    Is there some error in the push out logic?

    Or some error in the nearest point?

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Finish the article series

    Back port to talk slides

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Get polarized lense filters to remove stone highlight

    Rent a better camera

    Capture all go stone textures top and bottom

    Capture board texture kaya including sides

    Create Texture.h to manage sets of textures easily

    Switch to DDS files with offline mipmap generation
