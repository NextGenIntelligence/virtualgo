DONE:

    Work on render to texture. 

    Render stone stones to 2048x2048 texture

    So far I have chosen "LUMINANCE" 16 bit format.

    I'm not sure if this will cause problems or not.

    Yes, these formats are not renderable =p

    Apparently there is an extension here:

    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6076255/ios-how-to-render-to-1-channel-texture-in-gles2

    But this only allows rendering to R channel textures if you have iPhone 5...

    Earlier hardware does not support this extension.

    For now the safest option is to start with basic RGB888 texture.

    Single format textures must be viewed as on optimization for
    more recent hardware only.

    Setup ortho projection matrix for stone shadows render to texture.

    I believe the render to texture is now working, based on the fact
    that it accidentally caused glBlend to get stuck on at the end of
    the frame.

    Now I just need a vertex buffer for a quad.

    Done.

    First render the quad buffer and verify it shows up.

TODO:

    No it doesn't show up at all, if rendered after the render to texture.

    Why is this? Am i setting up the render to texture incorrectly?

    -----------------------------------------

    Really, really need to better organize meshes, shaders, textures etc.

    Names need to change and be standardized. Perhaps a struct that
    keeps the mesh, ib, vb, and vao together in one place.

    eg. MeshData

    It's getting impossible to name stuff!

    ------------------------------------------

    After this demonstrates the render to texture is working,
    next we'll probably need separate shaders for the render to 
    texture of the stones into the buffer.

    Once this is working start investigating how to get
    a pixel shader going that performs the gaussian blur.

    Once this gaussian is working the visual quality
    of the game will greatly improve!

    Once this is done, generalize and do the same 
    for the floor shadows, including rendering the 
    go board to the floor shadows in one pass along
    with the go stone shadows.

    ----------------------

    Consider turning on multi-sampling. Maybe it's fast enough for a 9x9 board?

    http://db-in.com/blog/2011/05/all-about-opengl-es-2-x-part-33/

    ---------------------

    There is a crash when a stone is dropped off the 
    board. I think the stoneMap gets out of sync 
    on the delete?

    Not really sure how this could be happening!

    --------------

    Floor shadow doesn't appear to show up. Z fighting?

    PAINFUL BUGFIX O_O

    -------------------------------------------------

    Sometimes stones simply don't collide.

    What is causing this? 

    It appears to be scene grid related.

    Can I catch this in the debugger?

    Can I reproduce this in the unit tests?

    *** THIS IS THE ONLY REMAINING OBVIOUS BUG ***

    --------------------------------------------------








    --------------------------------------------------

    Would be really nice to hold down off the board and
    have the stones "tighten" towards their constraints.

    Currently this can be approximated by randomly
    shaking the board. This is a bit weird! :)

    --------------------------------------------------

    Multitouch should not be able to drag stones together.

    To fix, implement an axis between each stone, or (0,1,0)
    if they have the same center.

    Along this axis check the biconvex support.

    If the supports overlap, push the stones apart along
    this overlap to make sure they move apart.

    --------------------------------------------------






    *** GAME POLISH ***

    -------------------------------------------------

    When a stone is colliding with the constraint
    sometimes it gets stuck in a bad orientation
    because of friction with the board.

    Perhaps stones while hard colliding against
    the constraint planes, friction should be 
    disabled, or reduced with the board, as to
    make the stone return to a good orientation
    quickly.

    --------------------------------------------------

    Touch events don't always come in at 60fps

    This is the OS being a fucking piece of shit

    It should be able to do this, but it's probably
    not fair to rely on it. Therefore, I must implement
    interpolation/extrapolation on touch events!

    Stone movement must be smooth and at 60fps
    at all times. Otherwise the illusion of solidity
    is broken!

    -------------------------------------------------

    It is sometimes jarring to see the stone hit an
    invisible wall, it would be nicer if this constraint
    had some softness to it, such that a soft guidance
    would keep the stone within the constraint most
    of the time

    --------------------------------------------------






    *** RENDER POLISH ***

    --------------------------------------------------

    Perhaps if I maintain a high res and low res mesh,
    then I can render the stones with a higher number
    of vertices, while having shadows using less.

    This would look visually better close up!

    --------------------------------------------------

    Some highlighting of the currently selected stone,
    eg. with pulsing of light intensity would also be
    cool.

    ----------------------------------------------------

    When a stone is removed it should be *at minimum*
    an alpha fade-out of both stone and shadow.

    Right now it just pops out of existence.

    This looks terrible.

    -------------------------------------------------

    Black stones should be slightly larger than white
    stones, both in physics calculation and in mesh.

    Would be nice to turn this on.

    -------------------------------------------------------------

    Render shadow to texture and blur out with gaussian

    This is probably the biggest visual improvement I can do 
    at this point.

    -------------------------------------------------------------

    Floor mesh should be rendered with a shader that has a
    spotlight effect. Otherwise the floor is going to look
    infinite, or have an edge, which looks weird

    -------------------------------------------------------------

    Board grid corners need special treatment, a corner texture to
    fix up the gap (otherwise it does not get AA properly...!)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Soften the edges of the go board by baking in some rounding,
    irregularity etc. They look super harsh and sharp right now!

    -----------------------------------------------------------------






    *** COLLISION DETECTION & RESPONSE ***

    --------------------------------------------------

    When a stone is dropped on top of other stones
    but has no empty point, it depresses the other
    stones briefly. This is wrong, but is probably
    best fixed by doing correct collision detection,
    not bounding sphere on the stone vs. some hack.

    -------------------------------------------------

    Get a basic linear collision response going
    between the stones so flicking a stone at another
    stone results in basically plausible collision.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Determine sets of axes required to test biconvex vs. biconvex

    Find axis of least penetration

    Implement proper collision response for two moving objects
    with angular effects. 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    I have disable collision between selected stone
    and non-selected stones.

    In reality, I want this back on eventually, as
    the user can launch stones while stones are selected
    which causes penetration.

    Penetration is not acceptable.

    -------------------------------------------------------------

    Now that collision detection is done using a tighter shape,
    dragging stones over other stones should look a lot smoother
    because the ramp up is less severe, eg. less energy being used
    to lift stones above other stones.

    -------------------------------------------------








    -------------------------------------------------------
    
    Would be really nice if I could dynamically adjust
    stone sizes and it would adapt the friction and
    damping settings. Perhaps linear interpolation?

    Would be really nice to let the player adjust stone
    size while the app is running. Would be a very cool
    demo of the different way stones move.

    eg. Do sizes 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40...

    Also would be nice to pass over all things that
    affect the stone and make them mass aware, eg.
    impulses should affect heavy stones less

    Perhaps I need to calculate the mass of the go
    stones at various sizes, and feed this in to the
    simulation. It seems the mass needs to be larger
    so that impulses would have less effect.

    ----------------------------------------------------------





    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Research solver. What do I have to do to implement the solver?

    I strongly suspect that I have to unify the treatement of static
    and non-static contacts in order for the solver to work, because
    the solver must balance the needs of the stones penetrating vs.
    the penetration with the ground and board.

    There must be a way to run the solver without running CD steps
    between each iteration. I simply cannot afford this. But how does
    this work with position correction against penetration?

    (The position offset, is that something that accumulates?)

    Need to talk to Erin to understand the core algorithm.

    Do I need to run CD in between each iteration?

    -----------------------------------------------------------------







    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Capture go stone diffuse textures

    Implement some way to swipe select between go stone textures

    Perhaps double swipe up/down -- I'd like to let the user
    mix and match go stones with different go boards.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------





    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Capture go stone sounds

    Buy a microphone

    Research how to capture foley

    Need sound of stone hitting board with different variations

    Stone hitting metal for the sides of the frustum

    Stone hitting glass for the front screen

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement double swipe detection

    Double swipe left/right select between different go board 
    textures, eg. light, dark, red wood etc.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------
