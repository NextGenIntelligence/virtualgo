DONE:

    Fixed the lights on the stone to look a lot better

TODO:

    ---------------------------------------------

    Create a new mode "Textured" (5)

    How to load a texture and use it in OpenGL?

    Emit texture coordinates in mesh. This is temporary. Eventually,
    they will become a function of x and z.

    Apply murasaki texture to the go stone

    Apply wood texture to the go board

    Work out how to improve the lighting on the board

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Damping needs to be made approximately framerate independent

    Why? Because in slow motion mode it really goes to town ... =p

    --------------------------------------------------------

    Finish the article series

    Back port to talk slides
