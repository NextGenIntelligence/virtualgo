DONE:

    It is difficult to tell 100% but it seems that the stone is not
    colliding perfectly with the edge, but has some separation out
    from the edge -- sliding the stone off the edge then zooming in
    should help determine if this is actually happening

    No, it is working fine as shone by sliding the stone up onto the 
    side edge from off the board, it lines up perfectly.

    Need another key mapping for zoom level now that I'm using CTRL
    left/right/up/down to apply a linear impulse to the stone.

    Hacked it in, now zoom level is ALT-CTRL+UP/DOWN (shoot me)

    Implement the remaining side cases

TODO:

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement bottom left corner case

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Copy across to all corners

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Its really nice to be able to specify initial orientation of the stone
    to demonstrate edge cases, eg. side on, vertical, slight 45 degree
    angle so it bounces into the board

    Provide a way to select the initial drop criteria for the stone
    so I can show off specific edge cases without fucking about

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    If you spin the stone really fast and then direct it into the side
    of the board it is possible to crash out with the collision response
    adding energy -- why is this happening?

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Argh... the wireframe is fucked up with z testing again... !

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement rolling and sliding friction

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------




    Polish only beyond this point!
