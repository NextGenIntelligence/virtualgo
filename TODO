DONE:

    Implemented a mode where the scene is rendered in solid colors.

    It looks awful! :)

    For some reason starting to get a lot of errors where 
    energy has been added by the collision response on spinning stones

    This did not used to happen. So now I'm wondering what made it start?!

    It was caused by adjustments to the nearest point on board vs biconvex

    To make this numerically stable, you MUST ensure that the nearest point
    will function even if the go stone is not on the surface of the board,

    eg. it must NOT reject nearest point queries if the stone is bounding
    sphere radius away from the board.

    Tidied up rendering and fixed board not obscuring the stone behind it

TODO:

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------

    Separate the broad phase rejection of collision detection from the
    categorization of the type of collision that should be checked.

    This is really important because otherwise the categorization
    cannot be used for nearest point checks, as these must function
    even when the stone is not colliding with the board.
