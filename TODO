TODO:

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Seems to be some sort of drift of the stone on the board?

    Why is this happening?

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement zoom in to point of double tap

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Red square in bottom left of screen. 

    If pressed it toggles locked mode. 

    Locked by default.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    In locked mode if a stones logically attach to a grid point
    when placed, and maintain relation to this point via constraint.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    In locked mode stones that fall off the board fadeout and 
    disappear after n seconds

    -----------------------------------------------------------------





    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement a way to pick the stone up with two finger swipe
    towards the stone, this is something Evan Cho naturally tried
    to do, therefore it is intuitive and I should support it. 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------



    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Board grid corners need special treatment, a corner texture to
    fix up the gap (otherwise it does not get AA properly...!)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Soften the edges of the go board by baking in some rounding,
    irregularity etc. They look super harsh and sharp right now!

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Fix up shadows so they dynamically adjust depending on orientation
    I really want the proper effect on the side when the stone spins
    of it lighting up. Also would be really nice to see the reflections
    on the go board change slightly based on orientation.

    Once this is done adjust the shadows in the zoomed in mode.

    Should be able to have nice divergent shadows when flat,
    while having good shadows on the side.

    Tune on iPad in zoomed out/in

    Tune on iPhone zoomed in

    -----------------------------------------------------------------








    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Double tap zoom in should remember the specific point where the
    zoom in was requested on the board, and zoom in centered around
    that point.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Instead of zooming in, maybe a second zoomed in view of the board
    can show while you are holding a touch past a certain point!!!

    This would also help fix the problem of not feeling confident
    about where you are placing the stone. 

    This should only show after an extended hold. It would be
    annoying if it would flick on and off.

    Would definitely help fix the FAT FINGERS feeling on ipad,
    if you can see under your finger, this is no longer an issue.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Really need to get textures for go board lines

    This is required for anti-aliasing effect, otherwise
    some lines look thicker than others top-down.

    Textures are simple. Reuse original Virtual Go textures

    -----------------------------------------------------------------










    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Capture go stone diffuse textures

    Implement some way to swipe select between go stone textures

    Perhaps double swipe up/down -- I'd like to let the user
    mix and match go stones with different go boards.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------





    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Capture go stone sounds

    Buy a microphone

    Research how to capture foley

    Need sound of stone hitting board with different variations

    Stone hitting metal for the sides of the frustum

    Stone hitting glass for the front screen

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement double swipe detection

    Double swipe left/right select between different go board 
    textures, eg. light, dark, red wood etc.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------









    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Seems that hold sometimes does not trigger. Not sure why yet?
    It seems that touch began triggers, but somehow the hold doesn't
    kick in. Maybe the touch began but it doesn't know where?
    Anyway, this is reproduceable so can be fixed later.

    Pops occur in the corners/edges. Need iterative contacts.

    Blow into the microphone moves the stone up (iphone only)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Prefer spin direction the stone is already spinning around on swipe

    If there is no existing rotation 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    The accelerometer not being accurate on side tilt is actually
    not true, it is caused by the frustum planes being not exactly
    flat.

    I'm not sure if I should do anything about this.

    I cannot clamp the value as I want tilting to work on side planes

    I could consider some sort of clamp to nearest plane normal
    concept if within some tolerence, this might be a good idea
    but would make sliding asymmetrical with the floor.

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement one-two click for placing stone

    First click places the stone but holds it in an alpha state? 
    50% alpha? It's where it will go, but it's not here yet...

    Stone should pulse in alpha actually while being placed...!

    Second click locks in the stone and it goes solid opaque quickly.

    Ideally sound effects for both phase, click - pah. 

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Implement iterative solver for simultaneous constraints (eg. corners)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------
















    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Fix tessellation demo so the two tessellation methods match

    Fix the rotation and lighting back how it was with y<->z

    Fix up the dynamics demo

    Fix up the unit tests

    Move the video recording framework into Platform.h/cpp so
    it isn't cut & paste in every demo program!

    -----------------------------------------------------------------

    Fix sphere vs. edge to include axes corresponding to
    each sphere touching the edge -- right now, not exact
    unless sphere hits 45 degrees.

    Fix bounce back off inside edge collision case (repro first)

    -----------------------------------------------------------------








    --------------------------------------------------------

    If you through the go stone at the corner (and edge?)
    in some cases it's possible to get the stone to "bounce back"
    as if it hit some invisible wall.

    Is there some error in the push out logic?

    Or some error in the nearest point?

    --------------------------------------------------------
