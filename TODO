DONE:

    ...

TODO:
    
    There is something wrong with my angular velocity math
    or with my velocity at point function, because I have
    had to explicitly invert the quaternion -> matrix
    conversion, and negate the angular impulse

    OpenGL coordinate system is right handed.

    Thought it was left handed. Switched!

    Verified that quat -> matrix needs transpose,
    otherwise rotation is in the opposite direction
    to what I expect.

    Verified that angular velocity is integrating properly
    eg. angular velocity of (0,0,20) rotates counter-clockwise
    around the z axis (positive direction, left handed rule)

    So then where is the inversion?

    It would SEEM that it must be inside my impulse calculation
    or in my velocity at point on rigid body function, because
    the angular velocity integration is working properly!

    Calculate proper inertia tensor for biconvex solid.

    ============================================================

    ============================================================

    Visualize stone vs. stone SAT

    Two stones rotating next to each other.

    Visualize their x/y axis supports for each stone.

    Add some vis when they are colliding.

    Consider whether or not we need additional separating
    axes than the current, it should be clear from the vis.

    ============================================================

    Implement nearest point on biconvex vs. biconvex

    This is required to determine the collision point and normal
    between two stones after bisecting to find intersection t.

    Visualize nearest points between biconvex if not intersecting
    in yellow.

    Add some key to move the biconvex further away from each other
    or closer together (left/right)

    ============================================================

    Generalize stones to an array of rigid bodies, array of
    biconvex shapes (don't assume all the same size...)

    Determine algorithm for detecting collisions globally

    Study speculative contacts approach and think through

    What about "ghost" contacts?!

    End result, should have a bunch of stones falling while you
    are holding space bar down. These stones should tumble and
    collide and come to rest on the board.

    ============================================================

    Implement biconvex vs. line intersection

    IMPORTANT: not ray intersection, but point/normal
    of intersection of biconvex against an edge!

    Assume that the line is infinite

    Based around nearest point on the line to the sphere,
    then it is just comparing the projected point to see
    if it is on the biconvex surface.

    ============================================================

    Implement left edge case SAT:

        1. may collide with primary plane
        2. may collide with left plane
        3. may collide with edge between primary and left plane

    Primary surface case is already implemented

    Left surface case is already implemented (plane again)

    Take the three cases and determine the area with the least
    collision. If any case is not intersecting, then no collision.

    Unit test edge cases:

        not colliding (vertically above)                            -
        not colliding (rotated such that not touching side plane)   |
        not colliding (rotated such that not touching side edge)    /

        colliding (rotated such that touching primary surface)      |
        colliding (rotated such that touching side surface)         -
        colliding (rotated such that touching edge)                 \

    Generalize fn so that it takes two planes as input, and finds
    the edge from these planes, and uses that to implement SAT.

    Therefore we should be comfortable that this case generalizes
    to the other edges without hard coding all these cases!

    Extend the to all edges.

    Unit test all edge cases.

    ============================================================

    Implement one corner case via SAT (top-left)

    Unit test corner case.

    Extend to all corners.

    ============================================================
